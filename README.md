# Molecular-Dynamics
The program does molecular dynamics simulations. It uses Fortran90 to perform the simulation, C to handle the IO and Python to analyze and plot the data.

The original code has been written for the course of "Laboratory of Computational Physics" to simulate the dynamics of a system of soft balls interacting with the Lennard-Jones potential.
The course of "Laboratory of Computational Physics" was a 10 ECTS course hosted in Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Bicocca during the academic year 2020-2021.
